# Title of the Project

- Here you should use up to three sentences to summarize what the project and especially the code is about.

[[_TOC_]]

## Prerequisites 

- what do you expect the user of your repository to have before the installation process
- things like
  - what hardware do they need
  - do you need a specific OS / Distribution
  - do they have to install specific libraries
  - do they need to check or change system configurations
  
## Installation

- what does a user of your repository have to do to make your software work
- this includes everything from downloading this repository to actually running your software
- e.g. steps like ```colcon build``` and ```source install/setup.bash``` etc.

## ToDo / future work

- if you know there are things you did not finish or cannot finish in the span of your project mention them here
- could also be a place for "known bugs" (could also be its own section)

## Resources

- if you have useful links, mention them here
- if you use other projects / libraries to build upon, mention them here
- if you get data sheets for your hardware, link them here
- etc.

## Documentation

- you can link to your report here
- you can also explain your arguments or parameters here, if applicable

## License 

- optional
- use MIT License

## Authors

- your names and a way to contact you

## Misc

Some things that you should keep in mind

- READMEs are always written in Markdown, so you can use its capabilities
  - use [links](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#links), [tables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#tables) etc. to your advantage
  - insert [images](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#images) or [videos](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#videos)
  - make your Readme a joy to read
- Another part of your documentation are your are your commits, so write [good commits](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/)
- the order of the paragraphs can be changed and you can of course add paragraphs and sections as you see fit

Keep your read me concise, if you have a lot of documentation, like a lot of parameters to explain then maybe it is a better idea to explain them in your config file directly and link to it. Or you can add a documentation folder to your project and link to Markdown files there. Another way would be to set up a wiki complementary to your code. Code documentation can also be done with tools like [Docxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/).

Good luck with your project!
